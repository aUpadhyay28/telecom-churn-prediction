I want to build a customer churn prediction web application using the following specifications:

Project Overview:

The app will predict customer churn based on input customer data using machine learning models.

Use Telecom Churn Data from Kaggle for training and feature engineering.

Frontend:

Create a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

The UI should have input forms for entering customer features such as purchase frequency, last purchase date, total spend, and other relevant info.

Display the churn prediction results clearly in the UI with labels and an interpretation message.

Include basic validation on input fields.

Backend:

Use Python with Flask (or Django) to set up the backend server.

Load pre-trained ML models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Regression) using scikit-learn.

Create API endpoints that accept customer feature inputs, process the data, make predictions using each ML model, and return results to the frontend.

Implement error handling and data validation on the backend.

Machine Learning Models:

Train and save Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression models for binary churn classification.

Train and save a Support Vector Regression model if predicting quantitative churn (like time until churn).

Include preprocessing steps like scaling and encoding in the backend to match training.

Provide evaluation metrics of the trained models.

Data:

Use the Kaggle Telecom Churn Data to engineer churn-related features and train models.

Define and implement churn target based on customer inactivity or irregular purchase behavior.

Deployment:

Deploy the app locally on localhost using Flask/Django dev server.

Ensure seamless integration between frontend and backend.

The app should be runnable from a single command with instructions for running locally.

Additional Features:

Provide detailed comments in code for clarity.

Give instructions on how to retrain models with new data.

Optionally, include simple data visualizations on the frontend for customer trends.

Please generate the full project structure and code snippets step-by-step, including:

Data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training code in Python.

Backend Flask API to serve predictions.

Frontend HTML, CSS, JavaScript code integrated with Bootstrap and calling the backend APIs asynchronously.

Instructions for running and testing the app on localhost.
